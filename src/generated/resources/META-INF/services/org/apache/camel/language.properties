projectName=Camel Operon Component
projectDescription=Camel-operon is a camel-component for running Operon from Camel routes.
               It is also possible to call Camel routes from Operon.
               Operon is a programming language which can be easily embedded with JVM-based 
               languages (Java, Scala, Groovy, Kotlin, Clojure, etc.) or run standalone with the native-version. 
               Operon is especially great for transforming and handling JSON-data.
